List of TODO

The list of things to be done in order to configure properly the new
Filco keyboard

- check http://rlog.rgtti.com/2014/05/01/how-to-modify-a-keyboard-layout-in-linux/

- check if possible adding a new layout (ca) without changing jp

  no way

- save original layouts from /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

- get the map for the key numbers in the filco's layout

- add the following keys

  * dead keys for accents open and close, and dieresis

  * enye and ce trencada

  * ordinals ro and ra

  * open exclamation

- document it to allow reproduction on laptop

  - include references to http://www.charvolant.org/~doug/xkb/html/xkb.html

- it should be possible to work properly on the standard 105 keys too.


- some keys are underused. You might want to assign them frequent keys
  that require some combination (e.g. accented letters)

  AE10: just maps to 0 and ~A
